For now scrap the manual environment and webpack setup.
Instead use the create-react-app tool.

1. Install the create-react-app (aka CRA)
npm install create-react-app

2. Make symlink to run it, unless you installed it globally
ln -s node_modules/create-react-app/index.js ./cra

3. Run cra
./cra lottery-app

This will create directory called lottery-app.

4. Make symlinks so that Symfony can find stuff
* from the Symfony web directory
ln -s ../frontend/lottery-app/build ./build

5. The controller action has to be modified to
render the plain index.html file generated by cra.

6. Make the rest endpoints so that the react app can
get the necessary data


* At some point will need to add Redux to the frontend stuff,
